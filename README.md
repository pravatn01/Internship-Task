## 🚀 Accomplished Tasks

### **Level 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing**

#### 🧑‍💻 **Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
- Explored the dataset, identifying the number of rows and columns.
- Handled missing values and performed data type conversions where necessary.
- Analyzed the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating") and identified class imbalances.

#### 📊 **Task 2: Descriptive Analysis**
- Calculated basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
- Analyzed categorical variables like `Country Code`, `City`, and `Cuisines`.
- Identified the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.

#### 🌍 **Task 3: Geospatial Analysis**
- Visualized the locations of restaurants on an interactive map using latitude and longitude.
- Analyzed the distribution of restaurants across cities and countries.
- Determined correlations between restaurant locations and ratings.

### **Level 2: Analysis and Feature Engineering**

#### 💺 **Task 1: Table Booking and Online Delivery**
- Determined the percentage of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery.
- Compared average ratings of restaurants with table booking vs those without.
- Analyzed the availability of online delivery across different price ranges.

#### 💰 **Task 2: Price Range Analysis**
- Identified the most common price range among all restaurants.
- Calculated average ratings for each price range.
- Analyzed which price range corresponds to the highest average rating.

#### 🔧 **Task 3: Feature Engineering**
- Extracted new features like the length of the restaurant name or address.
- Created new binary features, such as "Has Table Booking" and "Has Online Delivery."

### **Level 3: Predictive Modeling**

#### 📉 **Predictive Modeling**
- Built a regression model to predict restaurant ratings based on available features.
- Split the data into training and testing sets, evaluating the model's performance.
- Experimented with different algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boost) and compared their performance.
